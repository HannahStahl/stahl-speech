    "Alexandra “Ally” Stahl is a speech-language pathologist with 10 years of experience working with the pediatric population. After earning her masters at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she completed her clinical fellowship at an early intervention practice in Raleigh, NC. She spent the next 9 years at an outpatient center for Children’s National Hospital in Rockville, MD.",
    "Ally has experience diagnosing and treating mixed receptive-expressive language disorders, expressive language delays, and higher-order language disorders. However, she specializes in pediatric speech sound disorders including childhood apraxia of speech and phonological disorders.  Ally is trained in Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cueing (DTTC) and PROMPT. She is recognized by Apraxia Kids and the Once Upon a Time Foundation as a speech-language pathologist with additional training required for diagnosing and treating childhood apraxia of speech. Ally was also a part of the Velopharyngeal Insufficiency (VPI) clinic at Children’s National, assessing and treating hypernasal resonance associated with VPI. While Ally’s experience has predominantly been with pediatric speech and language disorders, she has additional training targeting accent modification with adults.",
    "Ally lives in Kensington, MD with her husband, daughter, and dog. Ally played Division I tennis while at Radford University and continues to be an avid tennis player."
